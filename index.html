        <h4>The Terranborn are a Colorado based Wargaming group</h4>
        <p>We focus on extremely narrative local game play with fully painted minatures on detailed and fully painted tables. We primarily play Horus Heresy though we also dabble in Necromunda, 40k, and even MESBG.</p>
        <p>Our main focus is to engage a narrative-driven, friendly gaming experience. Through monthly meet-ups and occasional events hosted all over the Denver area we hope to encourage more gamers to utilize the full range of the hobby and field only armies that are themed and have a story to tell. Anyone can roll dice, but the Terranborn tell stories.</p>

        <h4>Terranborn Presents</h4>
        <p>The Terranborn Presents is a collection of events put on by various members of the group. These events are highly narrative in design and range from open events hosted at a FLGS, like the lovely Heart of Gold store, all the way to small invite-only experiences which even go so far as to add some light immersion elements like fog/light effects. We work hard to provide a lore-based background and setting for each event, unless we are following named narratives from old Black Book campagins like Signus, Istaavn, or Thramas. Through the open events we hope to cultivate a larger group of gamers in CO that are invested in playing high-quality Horus Heresy. The smaller events are invite-only and thus more exclsuive, but tend to involve a much higher bar for play (including custom-made terrain, units, and even armies).</p>
